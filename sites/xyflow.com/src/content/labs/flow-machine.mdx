# Flow Machine

The Flow Machine project is an experimental UI for Strudel. You can use it to make music
with a flow-based interface.

### Visual Music Creation

Flow Machine transforms Strudel's live coding environment into an intuitive node-based
editor. Connect instrument nodes to effect nodes to create complex musical patterns - no
coding required.

### How It Works

**Drag & Connect** - Add nodes from the sidebar and connect them to build your musical
workflow

**Real-time Editing** - Modify patterns while they play with visual step sequencers and
effect controls

**Share & Collaborate** - Generate shareable URLs for your musical creations

### Node Types

Flow Machine includes 25+ nodes across four categories:

- **Instruments** - Pad sequencers, beat machines, arpeggiators, chord players
- **Synths** - Drum sounds and sample selection
- **Audio Effects** - Gain, distortion, filtering, spatial processing
- **Time Effects** - Speed changes, delays, pattern manipulation

Make music by connecting boxes instead of writing code - drop us a line with your beats at
