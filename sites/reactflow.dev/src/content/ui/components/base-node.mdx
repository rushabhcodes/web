# Base Node

A node wrapper with some basic styling used for creating a shared design among all nodes in your application.
Similarly to [shadcn ui's card](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card) the components file exports:

- The `BaseNode` main container,
- The `BaseNodeHeader` container where you would usually add actions and a `BaseNodeHeaderTitle`
- The `BaseNodeContent` container where you would add the main contents of the node.
- The `BaseNodeFooter` container where you may want to add extra information, or visible actions.

In case you need to fine-tune how interactions like dragging and scrolling work with your custom components, 
React Flow provides [several CSS utility classes](/learn/customization/utility-classes)

You should use the `nodrag` [React Flow utility class](/learn/customization/utility-classes)
in interactive components of your node such as buttons, to disable dragging
the node inside the flow when the user is interacting with buttons or sliders.

## Theming

To customize the visual appearance of your custom nodes, you can simply use
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes. All of the React Flow
components are based on [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and you should follow
the [shadcn UI theming guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) to customize aspects like typography and colors
in your application.

In most occasions though, when developing custom nodes, you may simply need to
add custom Tailwind CSS classes. All of the `BaseNode` components are just light wrappers around `<div>`.

For example, to change the border color of a node, based on an hypothetical execution status,
you can pass extra `className`s:

```tsx
// Assuming your component is receiving a `data` prop
export const BaseNodeSimpleDemo = memo(({ data }: NodeProps) => {
  return (
    <BaseNode
      className={cn('w-[350px] p-0 hover:ring-orange-500', {
        'border-orange-500': data.status === 'loading',
        'border-red-500': data.status === 'error',
      })}
    >
      {/* Your custom node definiton goes here */}
    </BaseNode>
  );
});
```
