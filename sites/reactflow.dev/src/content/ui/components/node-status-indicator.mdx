# Node Status Indicator

A node wrapper that has multiple states for indicating the status of a node. Status can be one of the following: `"success"`, `"loading"`, `"error"` and `"initial"`.

Additionally, the `NodeStatusIndicator` component supports different loading variants: `"border"` and `"overlay"`, which can be set using the `loadingVariant` prop.
- The `"border"` variant is the default and shows a spinning border around the node when it is in loading state.
- The `"overlay"` variant shows a full overlay, with an animated spinner on the node when it is in loading state.
