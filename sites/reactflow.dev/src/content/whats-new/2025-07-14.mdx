We have made some significant improvements to [React Flow UI](/ui) (formerly known as
React Flow components). These changes enhance the functionality, visual look and usability
of the components, to improive the general developer experience.

## Re-organize components

Some components have been moved to examples, while others have been consolidated in a new
structure:

- **Nodes Utilities**: These components can be used as building blocks for creating custom
  nodes.
- **Custom Nodes**: These are fully functional nodes that can be used directly in your
  application.
- **Handles**: These components are used to create connection points inside nodes.
- **Custom Edges**: Fully functional edges that can be used out of the box.
- **Controls**: Collection of interactive controls.
- **Miscellaneous**: Various utility components that don't fit into the other categories,
  like [`DevTools`](/ui/components/devtools).

Find all of them in the [React Flow UI page](/ui).

## `BaseNode` enhancements

Our BaseNode component has been fully revamped, to provide a more consistent experience
with [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and the rest of our
[React Flow UI component library](/ui).

The new `BaseNode` component now includes improved styling and wrapper components,
aligning to shadcn UI design principles.

Just like a [shadcn UI Card component](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card), the
[`BaseNode`](/ui/components/base-node) component now exports

- `BaseNodeHeader` and `BaseNodeHeaderTitle` for the header section,
- `BaseNodeContent` for the main content area and
- `BaseNodeFooter` for the footer section.

This structure allows for better organization of content within the node, making it easier
to create complex node layouts.

## Improved examples and nodes

We have also added a few new components and improved existing ones. Our component pages
now include more comprehensive examples that showcase the new features and capabilities of
the components. For example:

- New [`NodeAppendix`](/ui/components/node-appendix) component, which can be used to add
  additional information or controls to nodes, like a
  [`Node Badge`](/ui/components/node-appendix#example-badge)!
- The `AnnotationNode` component has been moved to an
  [example usage of `BaseNode`](/ui/components/base-node#example-annotation-node), to
  demonstrate how to style the `BaseNode`.
- The [`StatusIndicator`](/ui/components/status-indicator) now includes a variant with an
  overlaying spinner, and improved usage examples.
- The `TooltipNode` component, has been improved and moved to
  [`NodeTooltip`](/ui/components/node-tooltip). It is no longer a custom node, but rather
  an utility component that you can use to wrap a custom node with a tooltip.

## No more `selected` prop

You don't need to pass the `selected` prop to the `BaseNode` or its related components
anymore. Styling the selected state is now handled automatically by tailwind CSS
selectors.

However, `selected` is still a valid prop for nodes in React Flow, and you can still use
it to determine if a node is selected or not in your custom components. If you do not need
the `selected` prop for custom logic, but you only use it for styling, you can safely
remove it from your components, and you can follow how `BaseNode` is implemented to
achieve custom styling for your custom selected nodes.

```tsx
export const BaseNode = forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>>(
  ({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      className={cn(
        'relative rounded-md border bg-card text-card-foreground',
        'hover:ring-1',
        // React Flow displays node elements inside of a `NodeWrapper` component,
        // which compiles down to a div with the class `react-flow__node`.
        // When a node is selected, the class `selected` is added to the
        // `react-flow__node` element. This allows us to style the node when it
        // is selected, using Tailwind's `&` selector.
        '[.react-flow\\_\\_node.selected_&]:border-muted-foreground',
        '[.react-flow\\_\\_node.selected_&]:shadow-lg',
        className,
      )}
      tabIndex={0}
      {...props}
    />
  ),
);
BaseNode.displayName = 'BaseNode';
```
