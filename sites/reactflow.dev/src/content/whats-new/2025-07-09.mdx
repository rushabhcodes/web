### Restructured and updated content

We went over and updated our learn section. Here's what's changed:

- We slimmed down most pages and deleted some fluff that we felt didn't contribute to a
  better understanding of the library.
- Quickstart is now the landing page to rule them all, with installation and example setup.
- Getting started and concepts have been merged into one section.
- The customization and concepts section have been updated. Our mental approach was to shorten and
  clearly separate pages by context, making them easy to digest when read both standalone and in succession.
- In general texts include more interlinking between our docs sections, snippets now
  include highlights and the layout and headings have been improved for easier scanning of
  the text.

### Reworked code preview

Our code preview component has been updated with a sleek new design with an action bar that allows you to
toggle, copy, refresh or open the code in a sandbox. The default size has also been adjusted in
some places to integrate into the text better. Here's what it looks like:
