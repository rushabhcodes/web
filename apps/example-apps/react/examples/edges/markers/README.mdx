title: Edge Markers
description: Make your edges into arrows, add custom icons, or SVGs

React Flow has built-in support for different marker types for your edges. It's
possible to add your own [SVG
markers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/marker), too.

The markers are defined as SVG elements, so you can use any SVG you want.
The React Flow edge renderer will expect the marker definition to be in a `<defs>` element. 

If, for example, your custom edge is wrapping a built-in `<BaseEdge/>` component, 
you can pass the `markerStart` and `markerEnd` props to the `<BaseEdge/>` component.
The built-in React Flow edge components
will expect the `markerStart` and `markerEnd` props to be in the format
`"url(#markerId)"`, where `markerId` is the ID of your marker definition.

This allows you to customize the marker for a specific edge, depending on the state of the edge.
